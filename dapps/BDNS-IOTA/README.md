## üìù Description <a name="description"/>

The **IOTA-ID DNS Module** is a pioneering solution for decentralized domain name management on the IOTA blockchain, functioning as a Blockchain Domain Name System (BDNS). Unlike traditional DNS systems, which are centralized and prone to various vulnerabilities, our BDNS leverages the tree-like data structure of the IOTA blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant environment for managing domains and subdomains.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **üå≥ Tree-like Data Structure**: At the core of this module is a hierarchical tree structure, where each node represents an object, specifically an IOTA Shared Object. This means that every node in the tree is public, visible, and modifiable by all users through the functions provided by our smart contract. This openness ensures that the domain name management process is both transparent and decentralized.

- **üîë Ownership and Control**: Each node in the tree has an owner, who possesses full control over their respective domains and subdomains. Owners can create new subdomains, link them to unique addresses, or remove them as needed. The power to manage these subdomains is proportional to the position of the node within the tree.

- **‚ö° Optimized Address Lookup**: The tree structure is not just a metaphor but a practical optimization. Searching for an address within this hierarchical structure is far more efficient than in a flat list, as the tree allows for quicker and more organized data retrieval. This means that as the number of domains and subdomains grows, the system remains scalable and efficient.

### Why Use IOTA-ID DNS?

Our module empowers individuals and organizations to manage their digital identities and decentralized resources with greater security and autonomy. Whether you're building a decentralized application, managing digital identities, or simply looking for a censorship-resistant DNS solution, the IOTA-ID DNS Module provides the tools and infrastructure to do so with confidence.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use <a name="how-to-use"/>

The **IOTA-ID DNS Module** operates through a structured and logical approach that revolves around the concept of a "Node." Understanding the structure of a Node is essential to grasp how the module functions and how you can utilize it to manage domains and subdomains effectively.

### The Node Structure

A Node represents the fundamental unit within the tree-like hierarchy of the IOTA-ID DNS system. Each Node corresponds to a domain or subdomain and is defined by three primary attributes:

1. **ID**: A unique identifier for the Node.
2. **Name**: The name assigned to the Node, representing the domain or subdomain.
3. **Owner**: An address that holds ownership and control over the Node.

This Node structure allows each domain and subdomain to be a distinct, identifiable entity within the decentralized DNS system, facilitating organized management and retrieval.

### Main Functions

The module is composed of four main functions that enable the creation, management, and querying of domains and subdomains. Below is an overview of these functions, including their inputs, outputs, and a brief explanation of their roles:

1. **‚ûï add_subdomain**:
   - **Inputs**: 
     - A parent Node.
     - The name of the new subdomain.
     - The address of the subdomain's new owner.
   - **Description**: This function is used to create a new subdomain under a specified parent Node. The function generates a new Node for the subdomain, assigns it a name and owner, and marks it as a shared object, meaning it is visible and modifiable within the IOTA network. The subdomain's ID is then added to the parent Node using Dynamic Fields, establishing the hierarchical relationship between the domain and its subdomain.

2. **üóëÔ∏è remove_subdomain**:
   - **Inputs**: 
     - A parent Node.
     - The name of the subdomain to be removed.
   - **Description**: This function allows the owner of a Node to remove an existing subdomain. By providing the name of the subdomain and the parent Node, the function uses Dynamic Fields to remove the subdomain's reference from the parent Node, effectively removing it from the hierarchical structure.

3. **üë§ get_owner**:
   - **Inputs**: 
     - A Node.
   - **Outputs**: The owner's address is transferred to the sender.
   - **Description**: This function retrieves the owner of a specified Node and transfers their address to the sender. It is a straightforward way to identify and verify the ownership of any domain or subdomain within the system.

4. **üîç get_address**:
   - **Inputs**: 
     - A Node.
     - The name of a subdomain.
   - **Outputs**: The ID of the specified subdomain.
   - **Description**: This function allows users to obtain the ID of a subdomain under a given Node. By providing the parent Node and the subdomain's name, the function retrieves the subdomain's unique ID, enabling further actions or verifications within the decentralized DNS system.
